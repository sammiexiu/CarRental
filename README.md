# CarRental
Read the web service response JSON file that contains a list of cars information and extract the information as per client's requirements.

Precondition:
- Assume the Webservice response is a JSON file, so I create a sample.json under /src/test/.

- Test Project is created in Maven.

- Response Objects is constructed in Car.java, and the answers to the assignment is in Solution.java. The test project is under  ./src/test.
